Nos docti, pensantes
Sed non semper veridici
At the zenith of wisdom
No defying myself
To the point of reaction
You propose and I dispose
I see what you mean
It's clear, what you say
The truth isn't just a derivative of your views
Truth is a fiction of your views
These are my thoughts
No discussion
My righteous plan
Just think it over now
Another point of view
It's time we realize our errs
Where is it leading to if nobody sees it
There's never an absolute
Nos docti, pensantes
Sed non semper veridici
I can be so enchanting
With words beset in gold
Your senseless demanding
You propose and I dispose
I see what you mean
It's clear, what you say
The truth isn't just a derivative of your views
This is the way
No discussion
In my life
Just think it over now
Another point of view
It's time we realize our errs
Where is it leading to if nobody sees it
There's never an absolute
You're in denial
Can we trust all the facts
And believe that the fancied wise are just and needed?
Do we want to rely on the views
Of the righteous ones who are succeeding?
You look all around and you see
All the things that are not meant to be
Then you know it's time to let them go
Your fury can no longer stand
This hauteur will come to an end
Looking for leftover friends is in vain
You'll be alone again
No more refusal
Face it , slow down
It is for renewal
And expect no miracles
(Expect no miracle when you're in an endless fall)
No regrets if you're leaving
You're a true deceiver
(Accept the here and now
Or regret will end up)
Mas of justice, shield of menacing strength
Will not bend, only break
Can't we respect, Can we neglect
(No respecting so neglecting)
Those who are suffering in need of help?
(Those who suffer, needing our help)
You are the one I wouldn't like to become
(You are not the one I would like to become)
Not at all in the end
(Hear our calling)
Carry me slowly
In the depths of your life
(Fear the thunder)
Free me from barren fields
And grey thunder lies
(Semblance falling)
Under the grand facade
The truth loves to hide
Can we trust all the facts
And believe that the fancied wise are just and needed?
Do we want to rely on the views
Of the righteous ones who are succeeding?
You look all around and you see
All the things that are not meant to be
Then you know it's time to let them go
To let them go
Nos docti
Sed plus scimus
Non sperentes
Quod dicunt Alii
